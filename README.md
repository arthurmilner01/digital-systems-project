IoT dispensing system aimed at optimizing the operational efficiency within zero-waste stores. The project involved ESP32 liquids/solids dispensers, a Flask-based self-checkout application, InfluxDB facilitated dashboards, and real-time product capacity slack notifications. Communications and the flow of data between hardware was managed through RFID, MQTT and Node-RED. The project is accompanied by an 182 page LaTeX report.
